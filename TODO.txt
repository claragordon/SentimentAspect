Feature ideas
bi-, trigrams
POS tags (alone and appended) ngrams
sentiment backoff (use sentistrength)
POS filtering, upweighting
expansion -- wordnet, distributional sim
..MRS...
punctuation
positional features -- distance from start/end, aspect
character-grams
semantic role labeling

5/27
sentiment backoff (use sentistrength)
expansion
stemming
positional - relative to other aspects or adjective or clue word or start of sentence

tree based - position relative to root?

Parse-based
CoreNLP - node sentiments?
Dependency parse stuff**
constituent parse stuff
negation -- negativity
chunks
tree-based distance



Later on...
Rule-based -- confidences scores from classifier



**class readings?

ML
NB, MaxEnt, Adaboost
