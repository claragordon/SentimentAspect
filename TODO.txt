explore using MRS
adapt MRS code and parse data




perform sentiment term backoff on post-expansion
take the expanded terms of the closest adj and let them vote according to lexicon (distnce = tree or word)
how often if the sentiment of just the closest adj correct?

try differnt things with how many aspects are in the sentence (if they are in a sentence with a but in between, make them different polarities)
using the aspcet itself as a feature


Jared
expansion using word net âˆš
positional
punctuation
character grams?
prepend negatin NOT


Clara
Bi-grams
Tri-grams
Sentistrength Backoff
Reimplement POS
Some kind of tree-based?
unigram stopword removal


Feature ideas
bi-, trigrams
POS tags (alone and appended) ngrams
sentiment backoff (use sentistrength)
POS filtering, upweighting
expansion -- wordnet, distributional sim
..MRS...
punctuation
positional features -- distance from start/end, aspect
character-grams
semantic role labeling

5/27
sentiment backoff (use sentistrength)
expansion
stemming
positional - relative to other aspects or adjective or clue word or start of sentence

DEEP:

tree based
    distance from root
tree based - position relative to root?



Parse-based
CoreNLP - node sentiments?
Dependency parse stuff**
constituent parse stuff
negation -- negativity
chunks
tree-based distance



Later on...
Rule-based -- confidences scores from classifier



**class readings?

ML
NB, MaxEnt, Adaboost
